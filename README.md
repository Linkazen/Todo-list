# Take two of the todo_list website
First todo-list came out looking like spaghetti code and I decided to use what id learned from that failure of a project to hopefully transfer to this version.
So take two I guess first things are the list of features I need to implement.

## To-do
[ ] Create collections
    This really should be done first as one of the main problems I had was literally trying to redo everything to support this. ~~Probably wouldn't have been so bad if I didnt make functions do five different things~~
[ ] Create todos
    Pretty simple, make todos to place into functions.
[ ] Priority system
    make a priority system that prioritises showing todos with higher priority.
[ ] Style the website
    make sure the website looks good instead of doing that first when I don't actually know what I need.



Hopefully this goes a bit better than last time.
