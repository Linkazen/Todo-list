# Take two of the todo_list website
First todo-list came out looking like spaghetti code and I decided to use what I'd learned from that failure of a project to hopefully transfer to this version.  
So take two I guess first things are the list of features I need to implement.

## To-do
- [x] Create collections  
    This really should be done first as one of the main problems I had was literally trying to redo everything to support this. ~~Probably wouldn't have been so bad if I didnt make functions do five different things~~
- [x] Create todos  
    Pretty simple, make todos to place into the website.
- [x] Priority system  
    make a priority system that prioritises showing todos/projects with higher priority.
- [x] Style the website  
    make sure the website looks good  
- [x] Make sure todos can be created inside projects  
    Make it so todos will be able to be created and placed inside of a project  
- [x] Default collections  
    make a few default collections to sort misc todos based on what date they are due as well as what their priority

This has gone pretty decently, it all works and stuff although could use a little work on the functions as i copy pasted quite a lot of stuff.
