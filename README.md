# Take two of the todo_list website
First todo-list came out looking like spaghetti code and I decided to use what I'd learned from that failure of a project to hopefully transfer to this version.  
So take two I guess first things are the list of features I need to implement.

## To-do
- [x] Create collections  
    This really should be done first as one of the main problems I had was literally trying to redo everything to support this. ~~Probably wouldn't have been so bad if I didnt make functions do five different things~~
- [x] Create todos  
    Pretty simple, make todos to place into the website.
- [ ] Priority system  
    make a priority system that prioritises showing todos/projects with higher priority.
- [ ] Style the website  
    make sure the website looks good  
- [ ] Make sure todos can be created inside projects  
    Make it so todos will be able to be created and placed inside of a project  
- [ ] Default collections  
    make a few default collections to sort misc todos based on what date they are due as well as what their priority



Hopefully this goes a bit better than last time.
